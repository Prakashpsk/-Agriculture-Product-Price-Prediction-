## 🧠 Modeling
### 📝 Steps
1. **Data Collection**: Obtained the dataset from `vegetablesprice.com`.
2. **Data Preparation**: Cleaned the data, handled missing values, and performed EDA.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Standardized numerical features and applied one-hot encoding to categorical features.
4. **Data Splitting**: Divided data into training and testing sets with an 80-20 ratio.
5. **Model Building**: Built models using Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and K-Neighbors.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Assessed models using MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R² metrics.
7. **Results**: XGBoost Regressor achieved the best performance with an MSE of 1.37.

## 📊 Visualization
- **Bar Plots**: To visualize categorical features.
- **Scatter Plots**: To identify relationships between features.
- **Histograms**: To understand data distributions.

## 🎯 Conclusion
The XGBoost Regressor outperformed other models, making it the most suitable for predicting crop prices based on the provided dataset.

## 📌 Recommendations
- Implement this model in agricultural platforms for real-time price prediction.
- Explore more advanced models or ensemble techniques to further improve accuracy.
